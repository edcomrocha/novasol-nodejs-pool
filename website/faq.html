                  The dashboard lists the coins being mined, reward for each block, current effort on each block for the
                  merged mining. Sometimes the Pool Blocks section and Worker Statistics needs a refresh by your browser
                  to get updated stats. Typically that is pressing CTRL+F5 to flush the cache and ask your browser for
                  fresh data.

                  Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target. The target
                  difficulty changes from block to block based on the network hashrate attempted by all nodes on a coin
                  network. However, the difficulty for child coins can be dissimilar to the parent coin you start mining
                  with.

                  Mining is probabilistic in nature: if you find a block earlier than you statistically should on
                  average you are lucky if it takes longer, you are unlucky. In a perfect World pool would find a block
                  on 100% luck value. Less then 100% means the pool was lucky. More then 100% means the pool was
                  unlucky.

                  Share is a possible valid hash for the block. Shares are beings sent by your rigs to the pool to prove
                  their work. You should set your fixed difficulty to be somewhere around your hash rate average on your
                  miner multiplied by 28-30. Aim for your average number of accepted shares to be within the block time
                  (15 seconds for XNS) If your shares are accepted faster, but with lower difficulty each share is
                  worth less, but you should get at least one share in per average block time. It doesn't help the pool
                  by spamming a large amount of low difficulty shares. It tends to tie up more resources and might get
                  you banned.

                  It depends on amount of active miners. The more miners work on pool &rightarrow; the more hashrate
                  pool has &rightarrow; the more blocks are found by the pool. However the more miners are active
                  &rightarrow; the less reward you get from each block found. Probabilistically, even smaller pools will
                  less miners or hash rate will eventually get a block. Decentralizing the hash proof of work across
                  several pools on any network is important for security of the coin network, for both the parent coin
                  and the child coins. The block time is how long it can take on average amount effort. Some blocks are
                  solved faster than the average block time, some blocks can have a higher than average block effort
                  time. Also some other pools might solve the block first, and there is a slim possibility of an orphan
                  block on a child coin being mined.

                  An orphan is a block that didn't meet the requirement as a solution to the block found. Also, there
                  can be a situation where another pool or solo miner found the block solution first, and narrowly won
                  the race. Blocks are confirmed by hash verification by all the nodes on the coin's network. If there
                  is a consensus of which node <span class="font-italic">(pool, solo)</span> found it first, then that
                  block is added to the block chain permanently with credit applying to that pool/solo/node. A few
                  orphan blocks on child coins can happen when the parent coin's hash work doesn't meet the
                  requirements.

                  Proportional (Share-Based): Every time a block is found, its reward is split between miners according

                  is then applied to the reward of the last block found by the network and subtracting the small pool
                  fee. See the Worker Statistics page on the pool web page.

                  As soon as the block is found you will get your reward. Please wait a little bit more time. Payments
                  can be halted for various reasons within the automated pool software, but highly unlikely. There is
                  usually a minimum payout for each parent coin and child coins. Payments for matured blocks that meet
                  the minimum can also be triggered manually by a pool operator/administrator. Ask nicely in Telegram or
                  Discord support. Please have your information all in order before you ask such as miner application,
                  version number, gpu and cpu information, wallet addresses, and error messages reported.<br />
                  The merge mined child coins have a different number of confirmation blocks needed, but at least the
                  pool checks for fully verified blocks set at the interval on the Dashboard page. Not every parent
                  block found generates a child block. Check the Pool Blocks page on the pool. Or configure your
                  settings to get an email alert if you like on the Settings pool page.

                  Solo mining is attempting to find a block by yourself separate from the pool of proportional miners
                  collectively solving the current block.You get almost the entire block reward minus a small fee for
                  the pool. You can specfy your mining software by changing the wallet address with a prefix of "solo:"
                  added to your wallet specification. However, if the coin network has a high hash in total (see
                  Dashboard), the difficulty is also higher. Typically only very large mining rigs with at least 5-10%
                  of the coin network total is needed to get timely solo blocks. However, you could get a string of
                  blocks on lucky streak, then not find a block solution for a very long time. The more hash rate, the
                  higher the probability(luck). You can generate a solo configuration on the Getting Started page on the
                  pool. Tick the checkbox "solo mining". However, as solo you are also competing against the pool
                  proportional share miners, and every single node on the parent coin network also.<br />
                  In the case of solo merged mining specified in the pool password field, you are also competing against
                  the main pool users on proportional shares, and the entire child coin network and the other pools on
                  the parent network that are also merge mining. However the reward is much higher since you might get
                  two coin blocks(or more) for the same effort.

                  Disconnect your miner for five minutes at least. Then try again. Please pay close attention to error
                  messages reported by the pool software to your miner client software. Typical errors are invalid
                  parent wallet address format, or bad child coin wallet address specified in the pool password field.
